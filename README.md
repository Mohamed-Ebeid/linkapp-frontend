## Setting Up Your Project

1. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and run `npm install` to install all necessary packages.
3. **Start the Development Server**: Execute `npm start` to launch the development server.

## Integrating Expo QR Scanner

To utilize Expo's QR scanner within your app, follow these steps:

1. **Ensure Expo CLI is Installed**: Run `npm install -g expo-cli` if you haven't already.
2. **Open the Project**: Launch your project in the Expo Developer Tools by executing `expo start`.
